***Hi!***, I'm Alejandra González a.k.a. [blyxyas](https://github.com/blyxyas), a programmer, [Rust contributor](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Acommit+author%3Ablyxyas+org%3Arust-lang&type=commits) and certified girl.

I like to pet my cats, program about 10 hours a day with €0 compensation and be as scientific as I can about the world. This blog is mainly about programming and tech, but I'm not closed to talk about any subject I'm passionate about.

Have fun!
Cheers
