This will be a short one.

This blog is changing domain registrar, since I initially registered this `goose.love` (_lovely_ domain, I love having a domain registered with only one word, and having a `@goose.love` email address is fantastic), the domain registrar got merged with a corporation that I'm not too fond of.

After a few years of paying this corporation for my renewals, I thought "Maybe I could be spending better my money in a more local registrar". So I searched for one in my local region (i.e. Galicia, Spain) and thus, I'll be transitioning to that new registrar in a few days.

If you encounter any problems, please email me at `blyxyas at goose dot love`.

# The domain

**TL;DR: This blog will move from `blog.goose.love` into `goose.love`, and my "About me" page will be moved from `www.goose.love` into `about.goose.love`**

For those that don't read TL;DRs: _Read the TL;DR_

## Other updates

I'm still working on bringing tutorials. My main concern is not "obfuscating" the essence of this page. At the end of the day, this page is a semi-personal blog; An internet reservoir of my thinking and how it connects to the world.

My fear is that adding a section on <span style="font-family: NeueWorld-Bold, sans-serif;"><i>self-hosting</i></span> tutorials will tear that down. I'll still do them, but maintain them in a whole different section. Either one has to be separated, I'm still not sure which one.

And that's everything (at least, for now). Ahh, I missed those days where I could just post whatever I wrote in 20 minutes from time to time without too much worry.
See you on the flip side!
