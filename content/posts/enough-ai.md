OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT, althought that bit is obvious) has
unveiled _ChatGPT Atlas_. Their new chromium-based browser with ChatGPT
integrations right out of the box.

Asceticism is a lifestyle characterized by self-discipline and a withdrawal
from worldly pleasures. Multiple phylosophies and some religions have reached
the conclusion that suffering is the only path to excelence, and convenience
is a path for destruction and bad-habit making.

That's why I find myself yelling at clouds, because we were promised that in
the golden age of information, wisdom would be inevitable. But iall we're seeing
is innocent people fooled by a system that instructs them to avoid knowledge,
as thinking is evil, inconvience is no better than dead, and ðŸŽµ boredom is a crime ðŸŽµ.

We must reject this simplification of the contemporary life and build strength,
build independence from the people that see us as nothing more than a wallet.

While it may be depressing to think about the current state of the world, we must
(as in, moral obligation) be optimistic. Defeat is the moment that they
take over your hope. Do not let these corporations dictate your hope and
your worries about the future, as that's the moment that you're building your
the bird building its own cage.

## A concrete mantra

For today's enemies, the thing that they fear the most is strong people **organizing**
A necessary step in entrenching a fascist regime is separating strong-willed people
from each other.

Because mobilized people are strong, having people in the streets
is powerful; But a handful of well organized people are **unstoppable**.

If you really want to make a change in your community, make sure to be organized, have
a plan. Ensure your supply lines, identify who your threats are and who aren't and
engrain on your brain that you are uniquely a via for profit.

### Immediate action

There are lots of ways to act. As for immediate, easy action I can think of:

- Check out your local communities and interact with people of similar ideas in your city.
- Use small, personally-owned webpages. If you're in a stable financial situation, donate to the ones you use the most!
- Migrate from corporate-owned social media (e.g. Twitter) to open ones (e.g. Mastodon),
if you cannot find one, use an alternative open front-end. For example, instead of using Youtube,
I use [Invidious](https://invidious.io) (no ads, no tracking, no fingerprinting, and it stablishes a better
relationship with the platform)

Always remember that you're not alone, there are people interested in
taking ownership of their digital lives out there, and they aren't as rare as
you might think.

## From my part

I'll be posting some tutorials on degoogling your life, self-hosting and
my journey through finding alternatives and separating myself from
_the algorithm_.
