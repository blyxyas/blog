I wasn't planning on publishing this, but I just saw some other people talk about this and thought "why 
not?".

Google lets their employees choose one person (outside of Google) that they think were doing great things in the world of open source. And one person thought (Manish Goregaokar, A. K. A [Manishearth](https://github.com/manishearth)) that I may be that person that deserves being recognized. Why? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So yeah, an email came to my inbox on Oct. 10, 2023 congratulating me for being nominated, and after some other emails, yesterday, Dec. 1, 2023, the payment was initiated by Google. It was of 500 USD, quite a nice bonus for the month.

And that's the story! Thanks a lot to Manish, who nominated me. Make sure to check [his blog](https://manishearth.github.io/).

## Conclusion

It was a fun story, quite exciting not knowing the amount I was getting, and I'm really thankful for having this opportunity.

Now I'm in the cool-kids club who talk in their blogs that they're one of the winners :sunglasses:.
