Today, November 22nd, 2023, I have decided to set up a [BuyMeACoffee profile](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/blyxyas). It's pretty primitive yet, but hey, if someone doesn't want their money to go through Microsoft's hands **but** still support my work, that's now an option.

We even have a button! Look:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/button.prod.min.js" data-name="bmc-button" data-slug="blyxyas" data-color="#BD5FFF" data-emoji="☕"  data-font="Lato" data-text="Buy me a coffee" data-outline-color="#000000" data-font-color="#ffffff" data-coffee-color="#FFDD00" ></script>

I know, quite impressive!

## A new theme

The website you're looking at right now (unless you've decided to visit an old post, for some reason) is, while pretty customized, a premade theme. It's the Hugo [hello-friend theme, by Radek Kozieł](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend). You've probably seen a website like this a dozen times! <sub>If you peruse other dev's blogs</sub>.

So, I'm making a new theme! Its name is `baguette2`, there isn't really a connection with France or anything, it was the first thing that came to mind. If you're thinking "Wait, were's `baguette1`?" *`baguette1` never existed, kiddo*. Don't question it.

I cannot yet share a lot of info about the new theme, it will come when I feel it's ready. This means that I'll have to do some backwards compatibility work, as the current posts modify the blog's CSS according to how the `hello-friend` theme handles CSS. I'm not sure if I should be backwards-compatible with the theme or just change the CSS in those posts.

## About my inactivity

I know I haven't been really active lately (I don't even know if someone reads this blog), I have some medical stuff to sort out (along with the usual Rust developer work, and the "having social life" work), but don't worry, updates will come soon!

I tend to have high-stakes on the things I write, y'know, only writing when you're passionate about a subject. But maybe I should create more posts like this! Just me rambling for 2 minutes about incoming things. It's pretty fun.

So yeah, those were the updates I had, cheers and stay safe!
