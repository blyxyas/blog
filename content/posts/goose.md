Maybe you've noticed that the domain name of my blog and [about page](https://goose.love) isn't `blyxyas.github.io` anymore, that's because I decided to upgrade *my internet level* and buy **my own domain name :D**.

So now this blog is available at [blog.goose.love](https://blog.goose.love) (I chose this name because I find it funny) and my personal site / internet business card / future portfolio is at [goose.love](https://goose.love).

Maybe in the future, I'll create a dating site for geese. That'd be so great :D
Obviously, I made my email <silly@goose.love>, I was being forced, Ok??
