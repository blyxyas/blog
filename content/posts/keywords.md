I'm a frequent YouTube user, I've been watching videos as early as I can remember. If you are also a frequent YouTube user, you've probably seen the change in content creator's title style. There was an era when everything was IN ALL CAPS. Then, Everything Started Being Capitalized. Now, some videos simply don't capitalize their videos as the stylistic choice. Do you remember when they used \*\*ASTERISKS\*\* as if they made the title bolder than it already is? In the early days, everything had to be in its own series. If you made 2 vlogs, *now you have a vlogging series*! Yay :D

In this post, we'll use some science to discover the actual reality between titles and user's attention.

## User attention

We take more time reading more complex words[^1], and because of time being a slippery slope, a user may decide to spend a bit more time watching closely the thumbnail.

Turns out **I lied**. Readability tests such as the SMOG grading[^2] have some exceptions (e.g. "Wikipedia", a quite simple word nowadays has the same smog grading as "Anesthetic"), so words enclosed by asterisks don't work, as users just try to ignore these symbols (and <abbr title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</abbr>, YouTube doesn't format text in videos' titles). These asterisks could even annoy people, which could lead to them not clicking on your video.

**What about ALL CAPS?** Well, it's more complex than it looks.
Writing in full-uppercase increases performance when the task involves identifying single characters or individual words during briefer exposure.[^3] But, mixing lower and uppercase could give readers with dyslexia some confusion (as well as italic and underline in order to give emphasis)[^4]
