Depending on _when_ you discovered this blog, you may notice something different here...

That's right! A new theme. On the moment that you're reading this, the new theme will already be deployed. Read [this post on my BMC page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/blyxyas/launching-new-blog-theme) for more information.

## Cookies and tracking

If you're from Europe, you probably noticed the lack of a cookies disclaimer or a privacy policy. This is because the last theme didn't have tracking of things like visitor's country of origin or similar. **This will continue as-is**, fully private. I won't sell your data, nor collect it and this blog will continue being ad-free from the time being.

Pinky promise! ðŸ¤™
