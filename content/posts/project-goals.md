title: "Rust project goals & what's coming"

The Rust organization is starting an initiative for "project goals", in which every team submits a list of goals that they'd like to achieve in the coming months. I talked with my team on Zulip and got our hands dirty drafting a list of goals for 2024's second half. You can read the final document [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/optimize-clippy.html).

After receiving feedback and merging a few PRs to the project goals repo, and receiving a general ":+1:" from the team, we're adding "Optimizing Clippy & linting" to Rust's RFC for project goals 2024H2.

**This is great news!** Now the Clippy Performance Project that I talked about in other blog posts is finally formalized and held to a standard (+ anyone that wants to help, is greatly welcomed!).

You can read the other project goals on the [RFC PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3672), that will eventually get merged as RFC #3672

So yeah, if you want to read more about the "Optimizing Clippy & Linting" project goal, check out [the book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/optimize-clippy.html).

Peace! ✌️ :heart:
