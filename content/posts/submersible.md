Just before starting, I don't want to make fun of the people inside the Titan submersible or their family, this is just a post I wanted to make and well... I'm writing right now?

I'm sure you know about the Titan situation, but I'll make a quick recap over it.

OceanGate is a company that offered tours visiting the Titanic shipwreck (obviously underwater), in June of 2023 we lost communication with the submersible in the last tour and a few days later we confirmed that it imploded around two thirds on its way to the Titanic.

<sub>Quite ironic that the Titan imploded while searching for the Titanic's shipwreck</sub>

Ok, so a lot more info has been talked about since that happened, turns out that there was a 19-year old in the ship along with his father (poor kid, he was just doing something cool with his father) and the CEO of OceanGate was also there, so now... I guess OceanGate doesn't have a CEO anymore?

The multiple engineering mistakes made, the fired employees trying to fix them, the CEO simply lying, one of the billionaires' stepson being an asshole. Everything in this situation is just so captivating.
